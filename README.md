# ColorWheel

## Basic Overview
ColorWheel is an application created with the purpose of helping writers tell their story

## Features
- An online hub for storing all of your novels, allowing them to be accessed and downloaded from any computer as long as it has access to the Internet
- A section to organize research for topics studied and any other random notes that may be useful to be able to look back on
- An area for planning out scenes, goals, an chapter summaries in a way that is succint and well organized
- A place specifically to record important information about characters, from their back stories to their overall growth and everything in between
- An actual writing station where chapters can be saved and downloaded individually or as a full-length book
- A tool to help prepare for querying agents by storing queries, synosises, and cover letters
- An area for recording agents queried and tracking the status of a query--because really, who can remember when it's been 3 months since you queried a particular agent?
